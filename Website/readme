To create REST API:
we used object oriented architecture in PHP,
The main files are `insertData` and  `readData` which provide to insert data to Online Database in our website.

But here because we used **WordPress** as template of our website, practically we can't put our file in the directory 
and simply use it; so to solve this problem we add this piece in our file:
```
/*
* Template Name: readRestAqi
* description: >-
Page template without sidebar
*/ 
```
In the end we upload our files in the root directory of active theme in the following path: 
`Airpolito.it/wp-content/theme`

By adding the previous code, the word press recognize these two files as template, by creating two new page for each 
function (insert and read). the important notice, during the creation of page you must select the template from the 
right pane.

For more security on Rest api, we developed a basic authentication on the rest api, in which for 
each request(read or insert) is mandatory to pass user name and password.
